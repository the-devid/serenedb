# Compare iresearch-columnstore (PG INCLUDE) vs raw parquet on the ClickHouse
# `hits` dataset.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Start serened (perf binary from build_perf/) against a fresh
#      build_perf_data/ catalog/segment dir.
#   2. ATTACH a fresh DuckDB-native catalog (the third data point); set
#      search_path so its schema is visible alongside serened's default.
#   3. Create a view over read_parquet on the hits dataset (default in
#      $HOME/data/hits.parquet).
#   4. CTAS that view into a native DuckDB table (analytics gold standard).
#   5. Build an inverted index on a tokenized column with all the analytics
#      columns in INCLUDE -- that exercises iresearch_scan + the columnstore
#      materializer.
#   6. Run the benchmark suite three times per query, timing against:
#        a) the indexed view  -> iresearch columnstore path
#        b) the bare parquet read -> DuckDB read_parquet path
#        c) the native table  -> DuckDB native columnar storage
#   7. Report on-disk size: parquet vs build_perf_data vs the .duckdb file,
#      plus per-extension iresearch breakdown.
#
# Run this AFTER `scripts/perf/download_hits.sh` and after the perf build is
# in place. Output goes to scripts/perf/results/<timestamp>.log.
